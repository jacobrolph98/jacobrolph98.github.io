I first began programming around 2011, making small changes to existing games made on Roblox using their own version of Lua. This inspired me to take up Computer Science at school before specialising in Software Engineering at the University of Northampton where I graduated with a 2:1 in 2021. 

I enjoy programming in my spare time, to learn new things I can apply both in a career and toward my passion-projects.
