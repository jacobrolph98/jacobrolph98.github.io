My interest in programming started in 2011 when I used to play Roblox, a platform full of games made by the community. I began by reading through the code of free assets, making small changes to better understand how and why it worked. Later I started to repurpose assets and create my own games to play with friends and inviting others within the community, eventually gaining over a thousand visits to my games. This passion motivated me to study Computer Science at school, eventually graduating with a 2:1 in Software Engineering 10 years later. 

Programming is my most longstanding hobby and has sprouted to an interest in digital tech in general. I've spent countless hours tinkering with my computer and working on personal projects, both of which I get much satisfaction out of. I've set up a dual-boot system using rEFInd boot manager, so I'm familiar working in both Windows & Linux (Presently OpenSUSE Slowroll, previously Mint Cinnamon)

Much of my time programming has been using C#, Rust & Kotlin, though I've worked with others (Java, Python, PHP, mySQL, Cypher) for several projects during my time in education. I also have some experience in front-end tools, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript & React.
