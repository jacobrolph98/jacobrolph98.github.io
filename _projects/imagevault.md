Rationale 
=========

I started this project as I wanted further experience with creating web-based interfaces, as my last time was using PHP, HTML and CSS. 
Also as part of moving to a new game engine (Bevy) I want to learn Rust. As far as I can tell it appears to be a flexible language appropriate for systems programming, games programming, backends, etc and is well-rated for usability and memory-safety.
